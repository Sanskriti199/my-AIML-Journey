#AI/ML Learning Journey

This repository tracks my AI & Machine Learning learning journey with clean notes, code files, and mini-projects. I push everything directly from VS Code to stay consistent and monitor my progress.

#What I’m Adding

Python practice & fundamentals
Data analysis (NumPy, Pandas, visualization)
ML concepts, algorithms & experiments
Small projects as I learn new topics

#Why This Repo

To build consistency, measure my growth, and maintain a neat public record of everything I learn in AIML.
